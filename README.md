# Skin Cancer Detection Using Deep Learning
# *Overview*
<p>This project focuses on detecting and classifying skin cancer types (benign and malignant) using the ISIC 2020 dataset. The project incorporates segmentation techniques to identify skin lesions accurately and uses deep learning models to classify them. This work contributes to the field of medical image analysis by leveraging advanced machine learning techniques for improving diagnostic accuracy.</p>

# *Features*
<p> Image Segmentation: Extracting skin lesions from images for better analysis.</p>
<p> Classification: Differentiating between benign and malignant skin lesions.</p>
